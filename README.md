# College Event Manager
*COP4710 - Database Systems*

## Description
College Event Manager is a website that aims to solve the challenges of keeping up-to-date with events hosted by most universities around campus and off-campus. The website provides a centralized platform for college students to manage, organize and attend all types of events such as social, fundraising, tech talks, and more. Instead of students having to manually search each university's website, College Event Manager aggregates all university events, both official and unofficial, in one place. This saves students the hassle of missing out on events and gives them the opportunity to explore various events around campus. Additionally, the website provides a feature to track weekly events, ensuring that students never miss out on any exciting activities happening on their campus.
